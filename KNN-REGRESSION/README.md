# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR REGRESSION

- Trained, tested and validated a K-Nearest Neighbor Regression from scarch on the Diamond Price Prediction Dataset.

- Data Normalization
    1. Min-max Normalization
    2. Standardization

- Experimented with different distance measures to handle categorical attributes.
    1. Euclidean distance
    2. Manhattan distance
    3. Hamming Distance

- Results are Reported based on following error functions 
    1. Mean Squared Error(MSE)
    2. Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE)
    3. R-squared (R2) score

- Experimented with different K values (k=2,3,5,7,11,16) and Plotted a graph showing R2 score vs k.

- Reported the performance of scikit-learnâ€™s kNN regression algorithm and Compared it with the my algorithm.
