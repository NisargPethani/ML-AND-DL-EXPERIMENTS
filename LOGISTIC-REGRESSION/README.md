# LOGISTIC REGRESSION 

1. Implemented logistic regression from scratch to classify the images provided in the dataset. 
2. Loaded the dataset and perform splitting into training and test sets with 70:30 ratio randomly using test train split.
3. Ploted a diagram for the sigmoid function. This is used for binary classication. 
4. Handled multilabel dataset for classification problems. Used.
    1. one vs all
    2. one vs one 
5. Also got results using Log Reg from scikit learn.
6. Reported accuracy score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel useful and Compare the results - from all the three.

### LOGISTIC REGRESSION 1.1
- Experimented on sign language digits dataset.

### LOGISTIC REGRESSION 1.2
- Experimented on titanic dataset.
- Data cleaning plays a major role so, Reported all the methods used by me in the ipynb. Also,
    1. Checked for missing values
    2. Droped Columns & Handled missing values
    3. Created dummies for categorical features
