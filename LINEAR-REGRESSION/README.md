# LINEAR REGRESSION

-  Implemented Linear Regression from scratch and experimented on Diamond Price Prediction Data set.

- Results are Reported based on following error functions 
    1. Mean Squared Error(MSE)
    2. Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE)
    3. R-squared (R2) score

- Selected best suitable features you used to predict the price.
    - Based on Correlation between features and the Diamond Price

- Reported the performance of scikit-learnâ€™s linear regression algorithm and Compared it with the my algorithm.

- Ploted the graph for the predicted values from KNN regression, Linear Regression and Actual Diamond Price.
