# SIAMESE-NETWORK

Implemented a Siamese network on the MNIST dataset for classification.

## Tasks 
1) Use different loss functions  and compare the accuracies.
    - Triplet loss
    - Contrastive loss
    - Cross entropy loss
    
3) compare accuracies for various optimisers  and select the best one. Give reasons.
    - RMSprop
    - Mini Batch Gradient Descent
    - Adam Optimizer

4) Now try Hyper Parameter Optimization to improve the accuracy and report accuracies before and after.

5) Mention Pros and Cons of Siamese Networks.
