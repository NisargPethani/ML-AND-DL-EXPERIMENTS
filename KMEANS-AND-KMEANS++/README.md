# KMEANS AND KMEANS++

1. Implemented Kmeans & K-means++ from scarch

2. For the optimal number of clusters used following methods
    1. elbow method
    2. silhouette method. 

3. Defined the initial clustersâ€™ centroids using:
    1. Forgy
    2. Random Partition

4. Experimented with different distance measures
    1. Euclidean distance
    2. Manhattan distance

5. Ploted the error vs number of clusters graph using 
    1. the elbow method & silhouette method. 
    2. Report the optimal number of clusters found.

5. Reported the training and the validation accuracy and Compare your trained model with a model trained by the scikit-learn


### Part 1
1. Used the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset for this question.

### Part 2

1. In this task, perform operations on 
    - `[data.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NPkfXFoTkiRBlcI4ffe_Lp_BFOyf8UY/view?usp=sharing)`
    - data.csv is a  latent space representation of  Fashion-MNIST, before doing this task please read about latent space representation.

2. Load the data.csv file and apply Kmeans and Kmeans++, found the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette method.

### Extra
- From these experiments(Part 1 and Part 2), compared accuracy or error, and reported which one is better and why?
