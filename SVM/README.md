# SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

Implemented Support Vector Machines which are among the best (and many believe are indeed the best)“off-the-shelf” supervised learning algorithm.

### Section 1
- Worked on a synthetic dataset and visualize the boundary predicted by SVM. You will also vary the value of C-parameter and see how the decision boundary changes

- Also showed how the Quadratically Constrained form(which can be passed into the solver) from the basic principles of SVM algorithm

### Section 2
- Used the famous MNIST dataset to explore various kernels and report the results.
