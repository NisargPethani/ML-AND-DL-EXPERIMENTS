# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR CLASSIFIRE

- Trained, tested and validated a K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier from scarch on the famous CIFAR-10 dataset.
- compute the distance matrix using:

    1. Single loop
    2. Two Loop
    2. No loops
    
- Tabulated the time taken to compute the distance matrix using each of the three above methods implemented for k = 1, 3, 5, 7.
